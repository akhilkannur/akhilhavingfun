        <h2>Compressing Research</h2>
        <p>To compress research into outputs I can use fast (funded startup lists, prospecting heuristics, cleaned directories).</p>

        <h2>Cutting Friction</h2>
        <p>To cut friction in workflows. Example: instead of scraping manually, I throw messy data in and get it structured.</p>

        <h2>Reframing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>To reframe raw thoughts into different formats. I don’t let it be creative. I use it to show me 3–4 angles and then pick the one that fits.</p>

        <h2>Rapid Experimentation</h2>
        <p>To experiment with micro-projects fast. I’ve built directory prototypes, landing pages, and small tools without getting stuck.</p>

        <h2>Challenging Ideas</h2>
        <p>To push back against me when I need to see if an idea holds up. I’ll ask for holes in a framework or why a tactic won’t scale.</p>

        <h2>Smarter Prospecting</h2>
        <p>To support sales prospecting. I use it to filter out junk entries, spot signals others skip, and make data usable for outreach.</p>

        <h2>Reducing Overthinking</h2>
        <p>To reduce overthinking. If I get stuck in loops, I drop the notes in and let it organize my thinking so I can move forward.</p>

        <h2>Generating Options, Not Copy</h2>
        <p>To generate copy that isn’t polished, just options. I edit it back into my own blunt voice.</p>

        <h2>Staying Scrappy</h2>
        <p>To stay scrappy. I never use it for perfect outputs. I use it for speed, leverage, and testing.</p>

        <h2>Extending Reach</h2>
        <p>To extend reach. I turn research into short posts, lists into outreach inputs, and notes into newsletters so the same work goes further.</p>            </section>
