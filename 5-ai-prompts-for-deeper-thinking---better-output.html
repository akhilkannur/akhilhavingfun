<p>Here are 5 AI prompts that go beyond basic requests, designed to help you think more deeply and generate higher-quality output.</p>

        <h2>🔹 1. Framework Dissection & Reinvention</h2>
        <p>Template:<br>
        “Analyze the [framework/approach = e.g., Jordan Crawford cannonball outbound].<br>
        List its 5–7 core assumptions.<br>
        Poke holes in each assumption with real-world counterpoints.<br>
        Design a fresh framework that flips these assumptions and gives me 2–3 actionable moves to test.”</p>
        <p>Why it works: Forces depth + gives you both critique and new invention.</p>

        <h2>🔹 2. Philosophy → Unique Content Generator</h2>
        <p>Template:<br>
        “Based on my philosophies around [theme = sales, startups, data tinkering], generate [X] micro-blog ideas.<br>
        Style: contrarian, curiosity-driven, and non-generic.<br>
        Format: [short punchy lines / numbered list / thread ideas].<br>
        Output should feel like it could have been written by me, not generic internet advice.”</p>
        <p>Why it works: Anchors in your voice + constraints kill fluff.</p>

        <h2>🔹 3. Aesthetic Reference Upgrade</h2>
        <p>Template:<br>
        “My current site: [link].<br>
        Reference inspiration: [link].<br>
        I don’t want a full overhaul. Suggest exactly [3–5] precise changes (colors, fonts, spacing, layout tweaks) that will make it feel premium, modern, and clean—without touching functionality.”</p>
        <p>Why it works: You’re asking for surgical moves instead of vague design advice.</p>

        <h2>🔹 4. Brutal Honesty Diagnostic</h2>
        <p>Template:<br>
        “Evaluate this [idea/site/copy]: [paste].<br>
        Be brutally honest—no sugarcoating.<br>
        In 3 sentences, tell me the biggest reason this will fail.<br>
        Then give me 1 sharper alternative angle to test.”</p>
        <p>Why it works: Forces concise critique + immediate alternative.</p>

        <h2>🔹 5. Self-Positioning Shaper</h2>
        <p>Template:<br>
        “Here’s my current self-description: [paste].<br>
        Rewrite it into 3 sharper positioning options that:<br>
        Spark curiosity.<br>
        Sound confident but not cliché.<br>
        Stand apart from typical ‘builder/marketer/founder’ labels.”</p>
        <p>Why it works: Gives multiple options + enforces differentiation.</p>            </section>
