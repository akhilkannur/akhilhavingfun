                <h2 class="section-title">The Problem & My Approach</h2>
                <p>You've probably experienced the "lead gen death spiral" â€“ where agencies promise to know your market better than you do, only to leave you with a pile of unqualified prospects and a lighter wallet.</p>
                <p>The truth is, no one knows your customers better than you do. And no external agency can magically conjure up winning insights for your unique business. That's why I don't sell you emails. I sell you something completely different.</p>
                <p>I am not a cold email agency. I am not selling you leads or writing your emails for you. If you want to buy lists or outsource your outreach, there are plenty of services for that.</p>
                <p>What I offer is an "operations line" for your cold email efforts. Think of me as the architect who helps you build a robust, repeatable system to extract your *own* winning insights and systematically deliver them to more people who are in the exact same situation as your best customers.</p>
