            <h1>Stop Buying Emails, Start Building Systems.</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; color: var(--gray-dark);">Tired of cold email campaigns that promise the world but deliver lukewarm results? I'll help you build a robust, repeatable system to generate your own winning insights.</p>
            <a href="mailto:hello@akhilhaving.fun?subject=Inquiry%20about%20Cold%20Email%20System%20Setup" class="button" style="margin-top: 20px;">Get Started for $99</a>

        <!-- Problem/Solution Section -->
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Problem & My Approach</h2>
        <p>You've probably experienced the "lead gen death spiral" â€“ where agencies promise to know your market better than you do, only to leave you with a pile of unqualified prospects and a lighter wallet.</p>
        <p>The truth is, no one knows your customers better than you do. And no external agency can magically conjure up winning insights for your unique business. That's why I don't sell you emails. I sell you something completely different.</p>
        <p>I am not a cold email agency. I am not selling you leads or writing your emails for you. If you want to buy lists or outsource your outreach, there are plenty of services for that.</p>
        <p>What I offer is an "operations line" for your cold email efforts. Think of me as the architect who helps you build a robust, repeatable system to extract your *own* winning insights and systematically deliver them to more people who are in the exact same situation as your best customers.</p>

        <!-- What You Get Section -->
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What You Get for a One-Time $99 Setup</h2>
        <div class="benefits-grid">
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Your Core Message Framework</h3>
                <p>A structured process to help you identify the key insights and value propositions that resonate with your ideal customers, based on what you already know.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Customer Interview Guidance</h3>
                <p>A "forcing function" to help you conduct simple, effective customer interviews. This isn't about me inventing new messages; it's about helping you uncover what's already working and what your customers truly need.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Cold Email System Blueprint</h3>
                <p>A clear, actionable plan for setting up your cold email infrastructure (e.g., recommended tools, basic account setup principles, deliverability best practices).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Initial Template Structure</h3>
                <p>Not pre-written emails, but a framework for crafting your own highly personalized and effective cold email sequences, built on your unique insights.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h3>Empowerment, Not Dependency</h3>
                <p>My goal is to equip you with the knowledge and system to run your own successful cold email campaigns, allowing you to iterate and improve without constant external reliance.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Why This Works Better Section -->
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why This Works Better</h2>
        <p>This approach shifts the focus from external dependency to internal capability. You'll develop a deeper understanding of your messaging, your audience, and how to consistently generate interest. You're not just getting a service; you're building a valuable, transferable skill within your business.</p>
        <p>You're not buying someone who magically knows your industry better than you. You're buying someone who's excellent at helping you systematize what you already know but haven't fully captured.</p>
