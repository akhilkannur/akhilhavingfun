        <h1 class="section-title">Stop Buying Emails, Start Building Systems.</h1>
        <p class="disclaimer"><em>(I occasionally do this for fun, so spots are limited.)</em></p>

        <p>Tired of cold email campaigns that promise the world but deliver lukewarm results? You've probably experienced the "lead gen death spiral" â€“ where agencies promise to know your market better than you do, only to leave you with a pile of unqualified prospects and a lighter wallet.</p>

        <p>The truth is, no one knows your customers better than you do. And no external agency can magically conjure up winning insights for your unique business. That's why I don't sell you emails. I sell you something completely different.</p>

        <h2>The System-Building Approach to Cold Email</h2>
        <p>I am not a cold email agency. I am not selling you leads or writing your emails for you. If you want to buy lists or outsource your outreach, there are plenty of services for that.</p>
        <p>What I offer is an "operations line" for your cold email efforts. Think of me as the architect who helps you build a robust, repeatable system to extract your *own* winning insights and systematically deliver them to more people who are in the exact same situation as your best customers.</p>

        <h3>What You Get for a One-Time $99 Setup:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Core Message Framework:</strong> A structured process to help you identify the key insights and value propositions that resonate with your ideal customers, based on what you already know.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Interview Guidance:</strong> A "forcing function" to help you conduct simple, effective customer interviews. This isn't about me inventing new messages; it's about helping you uncover what's already working and what your customers truly need.</li>
            <li><strong>Cold Email System Blueprint:</strong> A clear, actionable plan for setting up your cold email infrastructure (e.g., recommended tools, basic account setup principles, deliverability best practices).</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Template Structure:</strong> Not pre-written emails, but a framework for crafting your own highly personalized and effective cold email sequences, built on your unique insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Empowerment, Not Dependency:</strong> My goal is to equip you with the knowledge and system to run your own successful cold email campaigns, allowing you to iterate and improve without constant external reliance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Works Better</h2>
        <p>This approach shifts the focus from external dependency to internal capability. You'll develop a deeper understanding of your messaging, your audience, and how to consistently generate interest. You're not just getting a service; you're building a valuable, transferable skill within your business.</p>
        <p>You're not buying someone who magically knows your industry better than you. You're buying someone who's excellent at helping you systematize what you already know but haven't fully captured.</p>

        <p class="price">One-Time Setup: $99</p>
