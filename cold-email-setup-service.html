                <p>Getting started with cold email can be confusing. Where do you start? What do you say? Will anyone even reply? Most beginners waste time sending emails that never get responses because they're guessing instead of testing.</p>
                <p><strong>The truth is, no one knows your customers better than you do.</strong> But you need a system to turn that knowledge into messages that actually connect.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Problem with Most Cold Email Approaches</h2>
                <p>You've probably seen agencies that promise to know your market better than you do, only to leave you with unqualified prospects and generic templates. They sell you emails, not systems.</p>
                <p><strong>I don't sell you emails. I sell you something completely different.</strong></p>
                <p>This service gives you the basics to get started with cold email, plus a simple framework to test your messages, so you can see what works before you scale. Think of it as getting the foundation right – helping you build a straightforward approach to test your <em>own</em> insights.</p>
