            <h3><a href="https://1000what.gumroad.com/l/IntelligenceDatabase">Behind the Scenes: My Sales & Marketing Intelligence Database</a></h3>
            <p>I’ve been tinkering with something I think a lot of agencies, consultants, and data-driven businesses will find useful. It’s a sales and marketing intelligence database. Think of it as a toolbox for finding prospects, digging into competitors, and getting a clearer picture before you even start reaching out.</p>
            <p>Right now, it includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>B2B SaaS and agency prospects, complete with tech stack and growth signals</li>
                <li>Competitor analysis to spot gaps and opportunities</li>
                <li>Sales prep tools like buying signal detection and ICP pain points</li>
                <li>PR and media outreach resources, from journalists to article analysis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Heads up: you’ll need an Airtable AI plan to make full use of it. It’s still a work in progress. I’m planning to keep adding new use cases, workflows, and ways to make it even more actionable.</p>
            <p>If you’ve ever felt like prospecting, research, and prep take too much time, this is me trying to make that a little less painful.</p>
