        <h1 class="section-title">No Agenda Call</h1>
        <p>30 minutes to discuss your internet project, startup launch, or business idea.</p>
        <p>I offer free 30-minute calls with no agenda, no pitch, and no strings attached. Just a conversation between two people who are interested in building profitable things on the internet.</p>

        <h2>What We Can Talk About</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet Project Ideas: Validating ideas, finding profitable niches, building MVPs, and turning concepts into revenue-generating projects.</li>
            <li>Agency Growth & Outreach: Finding better prospects, cold outreach that works, productizing services, and scaling without burning out.</li>
            <li>Tech & Tools: Building with no-code, automation workflows, data tracking, and simple tech stacks that actually work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>An open conversation about your project or idea</li>
            <li>My honest thoughts based on what I've learned</li>
            <li>A sounding board to help you work through challenges</li>
            <li>A fresh perspective from someone who's also in the trenches</li>
            <li>No sales pitch for my services (seriously)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>500+ Startups Helped | 0 Hidden Agendas</p>

        <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Founders preparing to launch their startup</li>
            <li>Freelancers wanting to build scalable businesses</li>
            <li>Agency owners looking for better growth strategies</li>
            <li>Anyone building profitable projects on the internet</li>
            <li>People who want honest feedback, not feel-good validation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What This Isn't</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A sales call in disguise</li>
            <li>Generic startup advice you can find on Twitter</li>
            <li>A pitch for you to buy my services</li>
            <li>Career counseling or life coaching</li>
            <li>Free consulting work (we'll keep it strategic)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've been experimenting with internet projects for over 5 years. It's a journey of trial and error, and I'm happy to share what I've picked up along the way. I currently run a few projects like Directory Listing Service and Leadsbrew Intel.</p>
        <p>I'm a big believer in keeping things simple and focusing on sustainable growth. It's a topic I enjoy discussing with other people who are building things online.</p>

        <h2>Ready to Chat?</h2>
        <p>Book a 30-minute slot. No agenda required.</p>
        <p><a href="https://calendly.com/akhilnairmk/30min" target="_blank" class="cta-button" style="background-color: #007bff; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;">Schedule Your Call</a></p>

        <h2>Before We Talk</h2>
        <p>Come prepared with specific questions or challenges. The more context you give me, the better I can help. Don't worry about having everything figured out - that's exactly why these calls exist.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If after our call you think my services might be helpful, I'm happy to discuss that separately. But the call itself is genuinely no-strings-attached.</p>
