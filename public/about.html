        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I started out in marketing, then spent the last 5+ years figuring things out on my own as a freelancer. I’ve done a bit of everything: sales prospecting, e-commerce management, outreach campaigns, digital products. Some worked, some flopped, all of it taught me something useful.</p>

        <p>Along the way I built ProspectingPal to help B2B teams with lead gen, co-founded LeadsBrew to track funded startups, and managed Amazon e-commerce accounts. Right now I’m focused on LISN, where we take live events and real conversations and turn them into video stories people actually want to watch.</p>

        <p>The common thread is simple. I like spotting opportunities and turning them into something real, whether it’s data, media, or people’s stories. Now I’m pulling those threads together into media projects and productized services with a small team backing me up.</p>

        <p>If any of this connects with you, let’s talk.</p>
