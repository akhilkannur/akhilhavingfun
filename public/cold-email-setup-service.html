                        <p>You’ve got people to talk to, a product to build, and 100 ideas to test — but somehow you’re also the researcher, the tech support, and the person fixing Zaps at 2 a.m.</p>

                        <p>I work alongside founders who still like doing their own outreach — they just don’t want to do it alone.</p>

                <p>Because they’ll never care like you do. Agencies want control. Freelancers want tasks. I want your outreach to work.</p>
                <p>I’m not trying to scale a service. I’m helping a few founders run better outreach — one small experiment at a time.</p>
