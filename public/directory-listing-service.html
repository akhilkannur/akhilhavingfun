        <div class="faq">
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What kind of directories will you submit my product to?</h3>
                <p>Only the best. We're talking high-quality, relevant directories that will actually send you traffic. No spammy, low-rent directories here.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long until I see results?</h3>
                <p>That depends on the directories themselves. Some are faster than others. But you'll start to see a steady stream of new visitors within a few weeks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you guarantee I'll get listed?</h3>
                <p>We guarantee that we'll submit your product to the agreed-upon number of directories. But it's up to the directories to decide whether or not to list you. That being said, we have a very high success rate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why shouldn't I just hire a cheap freelancer to do this?</h3>
                <p>You could, but the difference is that I'm a founder myself. I'm not just blindly pasting your information into forms. I'll personally review your product and submissions to ensure they are presented in the best possible light. I understand the importance of getting this right, and I'll treat your product as if it were my own.</p>
