<!-- for testing personalize the landing page content based on UTM source -->
<!-- HOW TO DEMO THIS FEATURE:
This demo showcases how a CRM product landing page can be personalized based on the traffic source (e.g., where the user clicked from).

1. Open this page in your browser.
2. To see personalization for Google Ads traffic (focus on sales/ROI), append "?utm_source=google" to the URL.
   Example: /public/personalized_landing_page.html?utm_source=google
3. For Facebook Ads traffic (focus on ease of use/management), use "?utm_source=facebook".
   Example: /public/personalized_landing_page.html?utm_source=facebook
4. For LinkedIn Ads traffic (focus on professional connections/client relations), use "?utm_source=linkedin".
   Example: /public/personalized_landing_page.html?utm_source=linkedin
5. Any other utm_source or no utm_source will show the default content, emphasizing general CRM benefits.
