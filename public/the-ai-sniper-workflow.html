<p>Most B2B outreach today is a volume game: buy a massive list, plug it into an automated sequencer, and hope for a 1% reply rate. While this works for scale, it often fails for high-value deals where context and accuracy matter more than numbers.</p>

<p>I've been using a CLI-based AI agent to handle my outreach. It’s not a "bot" that blasts emails; it’s a research partner that helps me verify, draft, and send emails one-by-one from my own inbox.</p>

<h2>The Workflow: Research, "Jam," and Send</h2>

<p>Here is how this interactive workflow looks, using a B2B SaaS company—let’s say a PropTech CRM called "EstateFlow"—as an example.</p>

<h3>1. Real-Time Verification</h3>
<p>Instead of relying on a static CSV, I have the CLI verify the target live.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Prompt:</strong> "Read row 10 (EstateFlow). Find their Head of Sales. Check LinkedIn to see if they recently mentioned expanding their regional teams."</li>
    <li><strong>The Result:</strong> The CLI finds that <strong>Sarah K.</strong> is the Head of Sales and she recently spoke at a conference about "The Future of Digital Real Estate in India." I now have a specific, relevant hook.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Contextual "Jamming"</h3>
<p>I don't use a fixed template. I "jam" with the AI to refine the message.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Drafting:</strong> I tell the AI: "Sarah spoke about digital real estate. Pitch her our localized UGC video service for property walk-throughs. Make it professional but direct."</li>
    <li><strong>Refining:</strong> The AI drafts a long message. I tell it: "Too wordy. Cut the intro. Focus on the fact that Indian buyers trust UGC 3x more than professional shoots."</li>
    <li><strong>Final Result:</strong> A 3-sentence email that hits exactly what Sarah cares about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Human-Triggered Execution</h3>
<p>No email leaves the terminal without an explicit "Send" command. I review the final payload in the terminal window, and once I'm satisfied, I trigger the send.</p>

<h2>Technical Setup: Connecting the CLI to Google Workspace</h2>

<p>If you use Google Workspace (business email), you can't just use your password in a script. You need an <strong>App Password</strong>.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Google Admin Settings</h3>
<p>As the administrator, you must allow these permissions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>admin.google.com</strong> -> <strong>Security</strong> -> <strong>Authentication</strong> -> <strong>2-Step Verification</strong>.</li>
    <li>Enable <strong>"Allow users to turn on 2-Step Verification."</strong></li>
    <li>Search for <strong>"Less secure apps"</strong> in the Admin Console and ensure users are allowed to manage their access.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Generate an App Password</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Go to your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security">Google Account Security</a> settings.</li>
    <li>Turn <strong>ON</strong> 2-Step Verification for your account.</li>
    <li>Search for <strong>"App passwords"</strong> in the search bar.</li>
    <li>Create a new one named "CLI Outreach" and copy the 16-character code.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: The Sending Script</h3>
<p>The CLI agent writes a Python script that uses <code>smtplib</code> to connect to Gmail's servers. Store your 16-character code in a local <code>.env</code> file (and add it to <code>.gitignore</code>) so your credentials stay on your machine, not in your code.</p>

<h2>Is This Better Than a Bulk Tool?</h2>

<h3>The Pros:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Better Deliverability:</strong> Since you are sending one-by-one from your actual, warmed-up business inbox, you avoid the "bulk sender" flags that often hit mass-outreach tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Customization:</strong> You can pivot your strategy mid-batch based on what the AI finds on a founder's Twitter or LinkedIn.</li>
    <li><strong>No Monthly Fees:</strong> You aren't paying $100/mo for a sequencer; you're using a simple script.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Cons (Where it Doesn't Work):</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Not for Volume:</strong> This is not for sending 1,000 emails a day. Google has daily limits (usually 500-2,000), and sending too many too fast will get your account flagged as spam.</li>
    <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> You won't get "Open Rates" or "Click Tracking" unless you manually insert tracking pixels into your HTML body.</li>
    <li><strong>Manual Effort:</strong> You have to stay in the terminal and approve each send.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a <strong>High-Touch</strong> strategy. Use it for the 20-30 partners that would actually move the needle for your business, not for thousands of cold leads.</p>                </div>
