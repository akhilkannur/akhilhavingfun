Here are 5 AI prompts that go beyond basic requests, designed to help you think more deeply and generate higher-quality output.

## 🔹 1. Framework Dissection & Reinvention

**Template:**
```
Analyze the [framework/approach = e.g., Jordan Crawford cannonball outbound].
List its 5–7 core assumptions.
Poke holes in each assumption with real-world counterpoints.
Design a fresh framework that flips these assumptions and gives me 2–3 actionable moves to test.
```

**Why it works:** Forces depth + gives you both critique and new invention.

## 🔹 2. Philosophy → Unique Content Generator

**Template:**
```
Based on my philosophies around [theme = sales, startups, data tinkering], generate [X] micro-blog ideas.
Style: contrarian, curiosity-driven, and non-generic.
Format: [short punchy lines / numbered list / thread ideas].
Output should feel like it could have been written by me, not generic internet advice.
```

**Why it works:** Anchors in your voice + constraints kill fluff.

## 🔹 3. Aesthetic Reference Upgrade

**Template:**
```
My current site: [link].
Reference inspiration: [link].
I don't want a full overhaul. Suggest exactly [3–5] precise changes (colors, fonts, spacing, layout tweaks) that will make it feel premium, modern, and clean—without touching functionality.
```

**Why it works:** You're asking for surgical moves instead of vague design advice.

## 🔹 4. Brutal Honesty Diagnostic

**Template:**
```
Evaluate this [idea/site/copy]: [paste].
Be brutally honest—no sugarcoating.
In 3 sentences, tell me the biggest reason this will fail.
Then give me 1 sharper alternative angle to test.
```

**Why it works:** Forces concise critique + immediate alternative.

## 🔹 5. Self-Positioning Shaper

**Template:**
```
Here's my current self-description: [paste].
Rewrite it into 3 sharper positioning options that:
- Spark curiosity.
- Sound confident but not cliché.
- Stand apart from typical 'builder/marketer/founder' labels.
```

**Why it works:** Gives multiple options + enforces differentiation.
