Cold email still works, but only if you set it up right. Here's a two-minute guide to getting started.

## 1. Get a Secondary Domain

Never use your main domain for cold email. Buy a variation:
- If your main domain is `company.com`, get `getcompany.com` or `trycompany.com`
- Cost: ~$12/year

## 2. Set Up Email Infrastructure

**Provider:** Use Google Workspace or Outlook (~$6/month)

**DNS Records (critical for deliverability):**
- SPF: Authorizes your email provider
- DKIM: Adds a digital signature
- DMARC: Tells receivers what to do with failed emails

Without these, you're landing in spam.

## 3. Warm Up the Inbox

For 2-3 weeks, gradually increase sending volume:
- Week 1: 10-20 emails/day
- Week 2: 30-50 emails/day
- Week 3: 50-100 emails/day

Use a warmup tool or manually exchange emails with colleagues.

## 4. Write Simple, Human Emails

```
Subject: Quick question about [their company]

Hey [name],

Saw that [specific observation about their company].

We help companies like yours [specific outcome]. Recently worked with [similar company] to [result].

Worth a quick chat?

-[your name]
```

## 5. Track and Iterate

- Open rate target: 40%+
- Reply rate target: 5%+
- If below, test new subject lines and messaging

That's it. No fancy tools needed to start.
