Most people building AI automation services fail. Not because their tech is bad, but because they're selling to the wrong customers.

## The Template Trap

Everyone's selling:
- "I'll build you a custom AI chatbot"
- "I'll automate your customer support with AI"
- "I'll create AI workflows for your team"

The problem? These are solutions looking for problems.

## What Actually Works: Pain-Qualified Segments

A pain-qualified segment has:
1. **An expensive problem** - They're losing money or time daily
2. **A measurable outcome** - They can track if it's working
3. **Decision-maker access** - You can talk to someone who can say yes
4. **Urgency** - They need this solved now, not "someday"

## Example: E-commerce Returns Processing

**The pain:**
- A mid-size e-commerce brand processes 500+ returns/month
- Each return takes 15 minutes of manual work to categorize, approve, and process
- That's 125 hours/month ≈ $3,000/month in labor costs

**The AI solution:**
- Automated return categorization using computer vision + LLMs
- Auto-approval for low-risk returns
- Flag only edge cases for human review

**The pitch:**
"We reduce return processing time by 70%. For a brand doing 500 returns/month, that's $2,000/month saved. We charge $1,500/month."

## How to Find Your Segment

1. **Look for repetitive, high-volume tasks** - Data entry, categorization, summarization
2. **Find industries drowning in unstructured data** - Support tickets, reviews, forms, emails
3. **Target companies too small for enterprise software** - They can't afford $50k/year solutions but will pay $2k/month

## The Real Product Isn't the AI

It's the outcome. Nobody wants "AI automation." They want:
- Fewer support tickets
- Faster response times
- Lower labor costs
- More closed deals

Frame it that way, and you'll close more deals.
