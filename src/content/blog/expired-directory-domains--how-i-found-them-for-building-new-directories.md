I've been building niche directories as a side project. The best part? You don't need to start from zero if you find expired domains with existing authority.

## Why Expired Directory Domains Are Gold

- **Existing backlinks** - Other sites already link to them
- **Domain authority** - Google already trusts them
- **Residual traffic** - Some direct/bookmarked traffic remains
- **Indexation** - Already in Google's index

## My Search Process

### Step 1: Use ExpiredDomains.net

Free tool with millions of expired domains. My filters:
- `.com` only
- Minimum 10 referring domains
- Must have "directory", "list", "database" in the name or archive
- English language

### Step 2: Check the Archive

Use Archive.org to see what the site was:
- Was it actually a directory?
- What niche was it in?
- How old was it?

### Step 3: Verify Backlinks

Use Ahrefs free backlink checker:
- Are the backlinks real?
- Do they come from relevant sites?
- Any spammy links?

### Step 4: Check for Penalties

Google the domain name. If nothing appears and `site:domain.com` shows no results, it might be penalized. Skip those.

## What I Found

In one weekend, I found:
- `saasdirectories.com` - 50+ referring domains, perfect for my SaaS directory project
- `localbusinesslist.org` - Had local SEO authority, now repurposed

## The Catch

You need to:
1. **Act fast** - Good domains go quickly
2. **Have a plan** - Know what you'll build before you buy
3. **Be realistic** - Most expired domains are expired for a reason

But when you find a good one, you're starting at mile 5 instead of mile 0.
