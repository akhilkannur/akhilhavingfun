        <h1>A Two-Minute Guide to Setting Up Cold Email</h1>
        <p><em>August 2025</em></p>

        <h2>Step 1. Buy a surrogate domain</h2>
        <p>Grab a domain that looks legit but isn’t your main one. .com, .co, .org—whatever works. Keeps your main brand safe while you run cold campaigns.</p>

        <h2>Step 2. Redirect the surrogate domain to your main website</h2>
        <p>Set it up so anyone visiting your surrogate domain can get to your main site. Shows your brand exists and builds credibility.</p>

        <h2>Step 3. Make sure your landing page is live</h2>
        <p>This is where your offer lives. One page, one focus. Test it. If it’s broken, don’t send a single email.</p>

        <h2>Step 4. Create a personal email address</h2>
        <p>First-person email only. akhil@yourdomain.co works. Get a Google Workspace subscription for your email. Set up <a href="https://docs.mailshake.com/article/329-how-to-set-up-a-dns-record-spf-dkim-and-dmarc" target="_blank">SPF, DKIM, DMARC</a>—otherwise your emails vanish into spam.</p>

        <h2>Step 5. Pick a cold email tool and warm up the domain</h2>
        <p>Close.io, Mailshake, Lemlist—any works. Don’t overthink it. Start small: 5-10 emails/day for the first week. If your target list is tiny, write manually first. See engagement, then scale.</p>

        <h2>Message Template</h2>
        <p>Hey [Name], you might be running into [specific problem], because [specific data point or observable signal / hypothesis based on similar companies].</p>
        <p>We helped [similar company] tackle it by [specific action you did, e.g., redesigned the 3-step onboarding flow, added in-app tutorial popups, and automated welcome emails], which led to [specific measurable outcome, e.g., 18% drop in first-week churn, 25% increase in completed onboarding tasks].</p>
        <p>I put together a short guide showing exactly how we approached this for [similar company], including the [specific tactics or steps], and thought it might be useful for you—feel free to take a look if it’s relevant.</p>

        <p>That’s it. Five steps. Buy the domain, redirect to main site, landing page, personal email, software + warm-up. Simple. No fluff.</p>

        <p>PS. Links? Don’t stress. Small volume, doesn’t matter. Only avoid spammy-looking stuff.</p>
